Roadtrip Explanation:I started my algorithm out by deciding the traffic. If there was no to very light traffic I assigned a 1. Light to moderate traffic was assigned a 2 to 3. Heavy traffic was given a five because I really hate traffic. I then gave a scenery rank based on personal presence. The better the scenery, the lower the rank. Finally , I gave the attractions a rank based on personal preference so that the lowest number (1) is where I wanted
